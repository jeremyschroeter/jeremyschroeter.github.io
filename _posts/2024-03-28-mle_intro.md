In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a fundamental technique used to estimate the parameters of a presumed probability distribution based on observed data. The mathematical formulation of MLE can be intimidating if you haven't seen it before, but the idea motivating it is extremely simple and has deep connections to abductive reasoning, also known as [inference to the best explanation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/). Here, I go over the basics of MLE as the first part in a series of posts explaining the connection between it and least squares regression. To begin, let's informally discuss a concrete example and then we'll try to generalize what we learn from it and get more rigorous.
<h5>Note: in this post I use MLE to refer both to the technique of maximum likelihood estimation, but also to the estimate itself</h5>
## Flipping Biased Coins
Imagine you are given a biased coin (a coin for which the odds of flipping heads or tails is not $50/50$) and are tasked with approximating the probability with which it lands heads. You have nothing at your disposal, no way to directly measure the weightedness of the coin. All you can do is flip it and see the outcome. How do you go about doing this? Your intuition probably tells you to observe a bunch of coin flips and simply count the frequency of heads. Our gut tells us that for a sufficiently high number of flips this number should approach the true probability. But is there a way to reason our way there without relying purely on intuition? Let's try.
<br><br>
Firstly, since we know there are only two possible outcomes we can say that if $P(H) = \theta$ then it must be the case that $P(T) = 1 - \theta$. Additionally, we know that we have to observe a large number of flips before we can say much of anything about the probabilities, and we also know that these flips are all independent of one another. Let's call the number of flips we observe $n$. Finally, if you've been exposed to basic probability theory you might remember that the probability of two independent events co-occuring is the product of their individual probabilities [A1](#appendix_one).
$$ P(x)\perp P(y) \rightarrow P(x, y) = P(x)P(y)$$
With this information we can write the probability of observing a particular set of $n$ coin flips which we denote as $\mathcal{D}$ given a particular probability of flipping heads $\theta$:
$$
P(\mathcal{D} \mid \theta) =
    \overbrace{\theta \cdot \theta \cdots \theta\cdot\theta}^{\mathclap{\text{times we flip heads}}} \cdot
    \underbrace{(1 - \theta)(1 - \theta)\cdots(1 - \theta)(1 - \theta)}_{\mathclap{\text{times we flip tails}}}
=\theta^k(1 - \theta)^{n - k}$$
where $k$ is the number of times we flip heads and $n - k$ is the number of times we flip tails.
<br><br>
Now, ask yourself the following question: given some observed set of flips $\mathcal{D}$, what value for $\theta$ maximizes $P(\mathcal{D})$; what value of $\theta$ makes our observed dataset most probable? Said another way, given a set of flips outcomes, what value for $P(H)$ could we choose that would maximize the chances of observing those outcomes? That number *is* the MLE estimate.
$$\hat{\theta}_{\text{MLE}}=\argmax_\theta{P(\mathcal{D}\mid \theta)}$$
At first encounter the MLE estimate can often feel slippery or circular. We are using our data to approximate a model that best explains...our data. However, MLE is really the operationalization of a deep intuition: *given an outcome, what conditions would have most likely led to that outcome?* The mathematical formulation may not be as intuitive, but the underlying idea is beautifully straightforward.
<br>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic">
"At a superficial level, the idea of maximum likelihood must be prehistoric: early hunters and gatherers may not have used the words 'method of maximum likelihood' to describe their choice of where and how to hunt and gather, but it is hard to believe they would have been surprised if their method had been described in those terms."<sub><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.2996.pdf">1</a></sub>
</blockquote>
If we have some data, and we are willing to assume that it comes from a particular class of distribution (a normal distribution, for example), then the MLE simply asks what parameters to give that distribution to make it **most consistent** with our data. In this example we arrived at our presumed distribution through reasoning about the flipping process, and now we are trying to find the value for its parameter $\theta$ which will best explain our data (maximize its likelihood).
<br><br>
Okay, lets see the MLE in action. We are tasked with solving the following optimization problem
$$ \argmax_{\theta}P(\mathcal{D}\mid\theta) = \argmax_{\theta}\left[\theta^k(1 - \theta)^{n - k}\right]$$
The solution to said problem will be our estimate $\hat{\theta}_{\text{MLE}} \approx \theta$ which is the approximate probability of our biased coin flipping heads. To start we can notice that whatever argument maximizes our function will also maximize its logarithm. This is because the logarithm is a [monotonically increasing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function?oldformat=true). Reframing the problem this way will allow us to get rid of those annoying exponents and turn multiplication into addition.
$$\begin{aligned}
\argmax_{\theta}\left[\theta^k(1 - \theta)^{n - k}\right] &= \argmax_{\theta}\left[\log(\theta^k(1 - \theta)^{n - k})\right] \\
&= \argmax_{\theta}\left[\log(\theta^k) + \log((1-\theta)^{n-k})\right]\\
&= \argmax_{\theta}\left[k\log\theta + (n-k)\log(1-\theta)\right]
\end{aligned}$$
So far all we have done is some algebraic manipulation of $P(\mathcal{D} \mid \theta)$. Now to solve the optimization problem, we can take the derivative of our function and solve for its maximum by setting that equal to zero.
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{d\theta}\log P(\mathcal{D}\mid\theta) &= \frac{d}{d\theta}\left[k\log\theta + (n-k)\log(1-\theta)\right]\\
    &=\frac{k}{\theta} - \frac{n-k}{1-\theta}
\end{aligned}
$$
Now we set our equation equal to $0$, replace $\theta$ with $\hat{\theta}_{\text{MLE}}$, and solve. For succinctness I will write $\hat{\theta}_{\text{MLE}}$ as $\hat{\theta}$
$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &= \frac{k}{\hat{\theta}} - \frac{n-k}{1-\hat{\theta}}\\
&=\frac{k(1-\hat{\theta})\hat{\theta}}{\hat{\theta}} - \frac{(n-k)(1-\hat{\theta})\hat{\theta}}{1-\hat{\theta}}\\
&= k(1 - \hat{\theta}) - \hat{\theta}(n - k)\\
&= k - k\hat{\theta} - n\hat{\theta} + k\hat{\theta} \\
&= k - n\hat{\theta}\\
\hat{\theta}_{\text{MLE}} &= \frac{k}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$
And so at the end of all of that we find that the maximum likelihood estimate for the probability of flipping heads given a dataset is simply the frequency of head occurences. Our intuitions have been confirmed! That was a lot of math for such a simple answer, but granted this was a pretty simple problem. Can the MLE generalize to a larger problem space where it's harder for our intuition to guide us? The answer is ***yes***, but before we get there, lets simulate some coin flips and see how our estimate does as $n$ increases.
```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
# Parameters
p_true = 0.65   # True probability of getting a head
n_flips = 1000  # Number of coin flips
trials = 50   # Do 50 trials with 1000 flips
trial_outcomes = []
for trial in range(trials):
    # Simulate coin flips
    outcomes = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=p_true, size=n_flips)  # 1 is heads, 0 is tails
    # Calculate cumulative mean of outcomes
    cumulative_mean = np.cumsum(outcomes) / np.arange(1, n_flips + 1)
    trial_outcomes.append(cumulative_mean)
# Plotting
plt.style.use('ggplot')
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 250
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
for outcome in trial_outcomes:
    plt.plot(outcome, lw=0.6)
plt.axhline(y=p_true, color='black', linestyle='--', label='True Probability of Heads')
plt.title('Cumulative Mean Estimate of Heads Probability')
plt.xlabel('Number of Coin Flips')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Mean Probability of Heads')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

## Generalizing the MLE
One of the most compelling attributes of maximum likelihood estimation is its broad applicability. MLE is not limited to specific distributions or data types; it can be applied to any situation where a likelihood function can be constructed. However, in its simplest formulation (the one discussed in this post) there are some strong assumptions we have to make about our data for the technique to work well. In the remainder of this post I will go over MLE in its general formulation and highlight what those assumptions are.
<br><br>
We begin by observing a set of data points $$X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$$
We assume these data points are sampled **independently** and **identically** from a **known class** of probability distributions $f(x, \theta)$, where $x$ is the domain of the distribution and $\theta$ is its parameter (we aren't limited to one parameter). Ultimately, what we want from MLE is an accurate approximation  $\hat{\theta}_{\text{MLE}} \approx \theta$ which is informed by our data. By estimating this parameter we will be able to construct a distribution which reflects our observations and which allows us to make statistical propositions about our dataset.
<br><br>
The first step in MLE is to construct a **likelihood function** $\mathcal{L}_n(\theta)$
$$
    \mathcal{L}_n(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(X_i, \theta) 
$$
The above equation says that our likelihood function $\mathcal{L}_n(\theta)$ is the cumulative product ([A2](#appendix_two)) of our assumed probability distribution $f$ evaluated at each of our data points $X_i$. Implicit in this function is all of the assumptions needed for MLE:
<br><br>
**(1)** Our data is comprised of independent, uncorrelated samples (hence the cumulative product [A1](#appendix_one))
<br>
**(2)** Each data point was sampled identically ($f$ is unchanging)
<br>
**(3)** We know the form of $f$, our model
<br><br>
But what does the likelihood function actually tell us? The likelihood function serves as a bridge between our data and a set of parameters. If we were to choose a value for $\theta$ and plug it in to $\mathcal{L}_n(\theta)$ we would get a number quantifying the plausibility of that $\theta$ given the observed data. Note that in the coin example we wrote the likelihood-function as $P(\mathcal{D}\mid\theta)$ however, strictly speaking this was a misrepresentation. In reality the likelihood-function is a function over the parameter space while the data remains constant $\mathcal{L}(\theta\mid\mathcal{D})$. The other notation, while useful for informally introducing MLE, implies a function over our data given a choice of parameters, which is not our aim. Our observed data is fixed and we are assessing the parameters' ability to account for it.
<br><br>
Understanding now what the likelihood-function tell us, it follows that if we want to find an approximation for the true $\theta$ which is unknown to us, we should choose the $\theta$ which maximizes $\mathcal{L}_n(\theta)$.
<br><br>
Cumulative products are in general more difficult to work with than cumulative sums, and so in practice we always work with the log-likelihood function $L_n(\theta)$ [A3](#appendix_three)
$$
L_n(\theta) = \log{\mathcal{L}_n(\theta)} = \log\prod_{i=1}^n f(X_i, \theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log{f(X_i, \theta)}
$$
Importantly, transforming the likelihood function like this 
### Appendix
<a name="appendix_one"></a>**A1**<br>
If this seems unintuitive to you, imagine you have a pair of unweighted $6$-sided die and want to know the probability of rolling a $6$ with both of them. If you were to roll a $1$ first, you haven't effected the outcome of the second roll and so there are still $6$ possible outcomes. The key is to realize that this is actually true no matter what number we roll first and so for each outcome of the first roll we have $6$ possible outcomes for the second. Thus our total number of possibilities is $6 \cdot 6 = 36$ and so the probability of any one outcome is $\frac{1}{36}$. In fact, if we had $3$ die then we would have $6^3$ possibilities each with probability $\frac{1}{6^3}$. Or if we added a coin flip we would have $2 \cdot 6^2$ possibilities each with probability $\frac{1}{72}$ because for each of the $36$ outcomes from the die rolling we could flip either heads or tails. All of this is a function of the events being independent from one another, and would not work if the outcomes of one process altered the outcomes of another.

If you aren't familiar with this notation, capital pi $\Pi$ is used to denote the cumulative product of a sequence.
$$
    \prod_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdots x_{n-1} \cdot x_n
$$
This is exactly what we did for the flipped coin example, where we wrote the likelihood as the cumulative product of the probability of each flip. In that example there were only two possible probabilities and so there was no need for this notation, we could just use exponents.
<br><br>
<a name="appendix_three"></a>**A3**<br>
The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the products factors
$$
\log{xy} = \log{x} + \log{y}
$$
Notice that this necessitates
$$
\log{x^n} = n\log{x}
$$
